I want you to know one thing
You know how this is
If I look at the crystal moon
at the red branch
of the slow autumn at my window
lf I touch near the fire
the mappable ash,
or the wrinkled body of the log
Everything carrie's me to you
As if everything that exists
Aromas,light,medals,
Or little boats that sail toward
those isles of your that wait for me,
well now.If little by little
You stop loving me,
I shall stop loving you
Little by little.
If suddenly you forget me
Do not look for me.
For I shall already have forgotten you.
If you think it long and mad
the wind of banners
that passes through my life,
And you decide to leave me
at the shore of the heart where I have root
Remember,that on that day, at that hour,
I shall lift my arms
And my roots will set off
to seek another land.
But, if each day, each hour,
You feel that you are destined for me
with implacable sweetness,
If each day a flower climbs
up to your lips to seek me,
Ah my love, ah my own,
in me all that fire is repeated,
In me nothing is extinguished or forgotten
My love feeds on your love, beloved,
And as long as you live
it will be in your arms without leaving mine.
